            <h2>Hello! My name is Nimish Adhikari, and welcome to my webpage!</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Nimish Adhikari. I'm from Kathmandu, Nepal where I was born and raised. I am currently studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Tufts University.</p>
                <p>I enjoy video games a lot, recently I've been playing Shovel Knight which has a great base game along with great expansions. I also play the guitar, and I can sort of noodle around on the piano. Nothing fancy though.</p>
            <p>
                On the left you will find links to my biography and my resume.
                On the right there is a picture of me and my brother!
