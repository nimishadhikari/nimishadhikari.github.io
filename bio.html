<h3>A Short Biography</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Nimish Adhikari. I'm from Kathmandu, Nepal where I was born and raised. I am currently studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Tufts University.</p>
<p>I enjoy video games a lot, recently I've been playing Shovel Knight which has a great base game along with great expansions. I also play the guitar, and I can sort of noodle around on the piano. Nothing fancy though.</p>
