                I was born in Kathmandu, in May 1996. For my name my parents used this old religious book, opened it to a random page and picked the name in it. Even though I live in Kathmandu,
                I am technically not from the city, I am from this small village called Starasaya Phat, right at the base of the Annapurna Mountains! I go there every summer to visit relatives.
